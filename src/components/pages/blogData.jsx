       In todayâ€™s fast-paced technological landscape, robotics is no longer confined to research labs or industrial automationâ€”it has become an essential part of education. At ForthTech, we believe in democratizing robotics by making it accessible and affordable for students and educators. Our latest innovation, the 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DOF) 3D-Printed Robotic Arm, is a testament to this vision. This project aims to provide hands-on learning experiences in robotics, automation, and programming without the high costs associated with traditional robotic arms.

        QuestionHeading: "1. Conceptualization & Design",
        detailedDescription: `
      The journey started with defining key requirements: affordability, ease of manufacturing, modularity, and robustness. We analyzed existing robotic arms and identified design constraints to ensure our model was lightweight yet functional. Using SolidWorks and Fusion 360, our team developed the 3D CAD model, ensuring a balance between flexibility and durability.`,

        secondQHeading: "2. Material Selection & 3D Printing",
        secondDetailedDes: `To keep costs low and fabrication efficient, we chose PLA and PETG materials for 3D printing. These materials offer a good balance of strength, flexibility, and affordability. The arm components were designed with minimal support structures to optimize print time while maintaining structural integrity.
